## Business Goal
The task at hand revolves around designing an algorithmic to determine the content of images, specifically discerning if the image features a dog, a cat. This process amalgamates advanced image processing techniques with machine learning methodologies to achieve accurate classifications.

## Data Description

The dataset is taken from Kaggle competition - Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition.

The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename. The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. For each image in the test set, you should predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

## Conclusion
The final result reach log loss of 0.69314 and accuracy of 96% on Validation dataset.
